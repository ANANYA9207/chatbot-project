**🤖 Rule-Based Chatbot**

This project is a rule-based chatbot built as a web application using Flask.
The chatbot responds to user messages using predefined rules and keyword pattern matching without any machine learning model.

It demonstrates how basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts and conversation flow can be implemented using simple conditional logic and integrated into a web interface.
